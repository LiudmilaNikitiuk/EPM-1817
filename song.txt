Stapled shut — Inside an outside world
And I'm sealed in tight —
Bizarre but right at home
I'm claustrophobic — Closing in
And I'm catastrophic — Not again
I'm smeared across the page
and doused in gasoline
I wear you like a stain,
yet I'm the one who's obscene
Catch me up in all your sordid little insurrections
I've got no time to lose —
I'm just caught up in all the cattle

Fray the strings... Throw the shapes...
Hold your breath... Listen

I am a world before I am a man
I was a creature before I could stand
I will remember before I forget
Before I forget that
